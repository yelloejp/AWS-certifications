# 1. 5 Pillars
- For well architectured design, Security, Reliability, Performance effectiveness, Cost optimization and Operation excellence should be considered. 
- AWS supports the framework for design principles. 

# 2. Security
- Properties 
    - Identity&Access management
    - Infrastructure and Data protection
    - Detective control
    - Incident responses
- How to design? 
    - Apply security in all layers to enable tracibility
    - Apply least previlliges
    - Automate well defined form as Image
    
# 3. Reliability 
- Properties
    - Recovery from issues/failures
    - Reliability in foundation, changes and failure management
    - Anticipate and prevent issues/failures by monitoring
- How to design? 
    - Test recovery procedure. After experiments apply automatic recovery. 
    - Scale horizontally (By monitoring, appropriate capacity can be measred and then apply changes)
    
# 4. Performance effectiveness
- Properties
    - Select customizable solution
    - Monitor and review continually for trade-offs 
- How to design? 
    - Democrative advanced tech. and adopt appropriate tech. 
    - Use serviceless architecture 
    - Do experiments 
    
# 5. Cost Optimization
- Properties
    - Cost effective resources
    - Match supply with demand
    - Optimize over time
- How to design?
    - Adopt consumption model and measure efficiency
    - Reduce physical operation and use managed service

# 6. Operation excellence
- Properties
    - Manage and automate changes 
    - Respond events
    
# 7. Big differences between traditional and AWS architecture
- Traditional(on premises) architecture 
    - Expensive 
    - Only mission critical application
- AWS architecture
    - Multi-Servers, Region, Availability Zones 
    - Fault tolerance
    
# 8. Tools for High availability and Fault tolerance
- High availability : Elastic Load Balancer, Elastic IP address, Route 53, Auto Scaling, CloudWatch
- Fault tolerance : SQS(Simple Queue Service), S3(Simple Storage Service), RDS(Relational Database Service)
